\usage{
plotPredict(
  x,
  ...,
  rk = NULL,
  lb = "Associated treatment effect",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{pteff}}

\item{rk}{object of class \code{vector}, if null, treatment effect are
plotted against their ranking, if not then they ara plotted against rk values.}

\item{lb}{label of the y axis for treatment effect.}

\item{xlab}{label of the x axis.}

\item{ctrl.plot}{controls plot legends (when NULL then internally ctrl.plot <- list(lb=c("Not treated", "Treated"),
wht="bottomleft", whs = "topright"))}
}
\value{
A plot on the current graphics device.
